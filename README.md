# Learning
Learning algorithms, test them, benchmark.

## Fifteen patterns
Added 15 algorithms patterns:
1. Using partial for calculations in array
2. Two pointers (from both ends)
3. Sliding window (move it using in and out values)
4. Fast-slow pointers to find cycles
5. Monotonic stack (find next largest/smalles value)
6. Top K values (find largest/smallest/frequent)
   ... more comming ...

## There are 3 projects:
- Class library
- Tests (Contains xUnit tests)
- Benchmarks (Contains benchmark tests)
