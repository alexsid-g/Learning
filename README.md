# Learning
Learning algorithms, test them, benchmark.

## Fifteen patterns
Added 15 algorithms patterns:
1. Using partial for calculations in array
2. Two pointers (from both ends)
3. Sliding window (move it using in and out values)
4. Fast-slow pointers to find cycles
   ... more comming ...

## There are 3 projects:
- Class library
- Tests
- Benchmarks
