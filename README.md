# Learning
There are data for MS Backend Developer course from Coursera.
Also there are some stuff for learning algorithms, test them, benchmark.

## Fifteen patterns
Added 15 algorithms patterns:
1. Using partial for calculations in array
2. Two pointers (from both ends)
3. Sliding window (move it using in and out values)
4. Fast-slow pointers to find cycles
5. Monotonic stack (find next largest/smalles value)
6. Top K values (find largest/smallest/frequent)
7. Merge overlapped (merges overlapped slots)
8. Deep first search (pre, in, post order traversal)
9. Breadth first search (using queue)
10. Matrix traversal (using recursive algorithm - fluid fill)
11. Backtracking (permutatoins and subsets, includung full generations)
12. Dynamic programming (fibonacci, stones, paths, knapsack)

## Documents
Contains materials, labs and practice from MS Backend developer course.
You can check code in Dot Net Fidler: https://dotnetfiddle.net/Widget/CsConsCore

## There are 4 projects:
- ClassLibrary (contains a class library)
- ClassLibrary.Tests (contains xUnit tests)
- ClassLibrary.Benchmarks (contains benchmark tests)
- ClassLibrary.WebApi (contains Web API)
