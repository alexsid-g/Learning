# Logical Thinking and Decomposition
## Algorithms and FlowChart
Deductive reasoning:
- Identify premises
- Analyse premises
- Draw a conclusion
- Check a conclusion

Flow control:
- Statements
- Conditionals
- Loops

Logic visualization with FlowCharts.

## Problem Decomposition
Split big problem to smaller simple parts and solve them one by one.
Modularization - create a separate module for each important part.

## Problem solving
### Top-down strategy
- Start with broad problem
- Break it down into smaller parts to solve them separately.
- Implement them and check separately.

Useful for design and debuging.

### Botton-up strategy
- Implement small parts
- Integrate

Useful when not enough knowledge about the goal.

## Pseudocode
Use it to clear approach before start to code.
