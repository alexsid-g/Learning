# Introduction to .NET and its Architecture
1. Intro to .NET and its architecture
2. Building Web APIs with .NET Cores
3. Serializatoin and Deserialization
4. Middleware and OpenAPI
5. Using MS Copilot in API development

## Backend Developer Activity
- Stay up-to-date: Learning blogs, courses, etc.
- Resolving complex bugs/issues: Crucial part is to reproduce bug locally.
- Security and Effic: Do not write it yourself, use existing libs.
- Cross-Team Interaction: Interaction with FE developers, DevOps team and Customers (End Users).

## Overview .NET Platform
- Technologies: ASP.NET (MVC, Razor Pages, Blazor), .NET Core, MAUI (Xmarine successor), ML.NET .
- Tools: VS Code, CLI (dotnet, dump review)
- Package Management: NuGet

## .NET Platforms
### .NET Framework (Legacy)
1. CLR (common language runtime - executor)
2. BCL (base class library - set of reusable classes and interfaces for dev)
Limitetions:
- Tightly coupled to Windows OS.
- Lacks moder performance optimizations.
- Monolitic structures (not an optimal build).

### Modern .NET
.NET Platform = .NET Framework (Legacy) + .NET Core + .NET Xamarine (MAUI)
Key Features:
- Works well with cloud
- Simplifies cloud deployment
- Regulary updated for latest tools
- Support automated testing and deployment
- Multiple programming languages
