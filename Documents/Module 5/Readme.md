# Functions, Methods and Parameters

## Functions
Functions offer several major advantages in programming:
1. **Reusability**: The same function can be called multiple times across the program without duplicating code.
2. **Modularity**: By breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable functions, developers make the code more readable and easier to debug.
    - Improved readability
    - Reusability
    - Easier testing
3. **Maintainability**: If a function's logic needs to change, it can be updated in one place, and those changes are automatically reflected wherever the function is used.

## Methods 
Methods are like functions but grouped to a single unit (associated with class - peace of data). Their UseCases are:
- Prforming calculations
- Handling events
- Manipulating data
    - (?) Perform some action (show message)

## Develop programs 
- Break down programm into smaller tasks
- Represent each task with method/function

Single responsibility - unit/method should have only one reason to change.

## Comprehensive Program Development 

### Project Planning
1. Defining project scope
2. Identifying core functions
3. Integrating and consolidating functions
4. Planning program forkflow (from start to finish), loops and conditionals

### Implementation
1. Start with core functions
2. Integrate the functions
3. Apply loops and conditionals
4. Test and debug

### Final integration and testing
1. Perform final integration test
