## Inventory management system
To complete this challenge, you will need to create a console application where users can manage product stock. Users should be able to add new products, update stock, and remove products.

Some key features include:
- Add new products with name, price, and stock quantity.
- Update stock when products are sold or restocked.
- View all products and their stock levels.
- Remove products from inventory.

Some shortcuts:
* ND - not defined
* TBD - to be defined
* TBE - to be estimated 
* NeCR - No error, correct result

## 1. Requirments
Functional (take from project description):
- Add new products with name, price, and stock quantity.
- Update stock when products are sold or restocked.
- View all products and their stock levels.
- Remove products from inventory.
Non-functional:
- Should run in DotNetFiddle after copy/paste

## 2. Objectives
### Build code base
- Create product, has class (name, price, and stock quantity), TBE
- Create Inventory, has class, TBE
- Implement add logic, product can be added, TBE
- Implement update stock logic, product stock can be updated, TBE
- Implement view products, product list can be viewed, TBE 
- Implemnt remove product, product can be removed, TBE
### Complete debug and tesing
- Check add logic, NeCR, TBE
- Check update logic, NeCR, TBE
- Check view logic, NeCR, TBE
- Check remove logic, NeCR, TBE
### Delivery
- Save code, file with code exists
### Monitoring
ND 

## 3. Outline
