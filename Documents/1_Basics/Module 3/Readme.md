# Algorithm Structure

1. Conditional statements (if, switch)
2. Categorical statements
3. Binary structures

## Categorical statements
Universal and Particular Affirmative/Negative:
- ALL A are B
- ALL A are not B
- SOME A are B
- SOME A are not B.

## Binary structures
Conditional flag like: YES or NO.

## Flow charts
- Create it 
- Analyse its accuracy 
Errors:
1. Missing steps
2. Incorrect sequence
3. Ambigous decision points
4. Poorly defined start/end points

## Algorithm Steps
1. Understanding the problem,
2. Diagramming and outlining the solution,
3. Writing it all down in pseudocode
4. Translate to C#
