# Practical application

## Problem solving algorithm
1. Break down a problem
2. Identify codig concept
3. Structure your code
4. Implement and test

## Review and Refinement
- Readable variable names
- Use single responsibility principle

## Debugging
It is a process of identifying and resolveing errors and bugs in your code.
Use tools like Chrome DevTools, PyCharm debugger, VS Debugger
- Examin error meessages
- Reproducing and isolating an error
- Analysing and fixing issues

### Errors:
- Logic
- Syntax
- Runtime
### Technics:
- Watches
- Logging
- Print statements
- Breakpoints
### Using MS Copilot
- Code generation
- Real-time code suggestion
- Automatic error detection
- Code optimization
