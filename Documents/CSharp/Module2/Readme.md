# Apply Programming Foundations
## Essential Concepts
- Logical operations
- Conditional statements (if, switch)
- Cycles (for, while)
- Organize code with methods
- Planing with pseudocode

## Logical thinking
Process of applying systematic reasoning to define a problem and arrive solution.

### Deductive reasoning (debugging)
- Premises (general)
- Conclusion Drawings

### Inductive reasoning
- Examine specific patterns and observetions
- Conclusion Drawings (generalization)

## Problem decomposition
### Top-down approach
Break down a big problem into a smaller manageble tasks

### Bottom-up approach
Starting with the most basic elements and combine them to create a broad solution. Useful when a lot of facts.
- Identify basic components
- Combine them to build larger components 
- Integrate large components to form one system

## Operations
### Investigate issues
- Start with observed issue
- Develop premises
- Draw conclusions
- Decompose the problem
- Progressively solve the root cause

### Debugging a Function
- Identify a new problem
- Apply deductive reasoning
- Test hypotesis

### Optimizing an Algorithm
- Analyse performance
- Apply inductive reasoning (idetify patterns and repetetive operations which slow down performance)
- Refactor code
- Check result

### Design new feature
- Define requierments
- Use deductive reasoning (how to interact with existing components)
- Implement and test

## Debugging
### Common type of errors
- Syntax errors
- Runtime errors
- Logic errors

### Debugging tools/techniques
- Breakpoints
- Inspecting values of variables
- Step through the code
- Print error messages
