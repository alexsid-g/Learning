# Copilot Microsoft
Copilot changed development from imperative to declarative.
Capabilities:
- Application structure and organization
- Debugging Assistance
- Integration with IDE

Enhanced Productivities:
- Provides automated code suggestions
- Streamlines repetetive tasks
- Properly formats code

Error reduction;
- Provides real-time feedback
- Code quality suggestions (improve quality)
- Bug analysis

## Usage of Copilot
1. Generate code for common tasks
    - Handling data
    - Managing user's input
    - Create basic algorithms
2. Create basic algorithms
3. Integrates code
    - Suggest alternative approaches
    - Suggest more efficient way of doing things
    - Seamlessly integrates snippets (adds directly, maintain consistency)

## Debugging with Copilot
You can review code to find bugs/potential bugs and improve it.

## Optimize with Copilot
You can asks copilot:
1. Refactor complex code for better maintanability
    - Prompt: Refactor this method to improve readability and maintainability
    - Result: Simplified, easier-to-maintain code.
2. Enhance readability
    - Prompt: Suggest better name
    - Result: More understandable code.
3. Improve performance
    - Prompt: Optimize this loop/code for better performance.
    - Result: Faster execution time.

## Crafting effective prompts
- Be specific (improve loop performance vs help with this code)
- Provide context and iterate on suggestions
- Refine your prompt
- Use clear language
- Break down tasks
- Asks for examples

## Solve coding chalanges with MS Copilot
### Algorithm design efficiency
- It helps you create efficient algorithms quickly.
### Data processing challenge
- Copilot can generate code to handle complex data tasks.
### Application logic challenge
- It assists in structuring your code's logic. Creates basic structure.

## ALGORITHM REFINING
- Review generated code (check clarity, efficiency, adherence to best practices)
- Test the Algorithm (run various test cases includin endge cases)
- Optimize Performance (analyze time and space complexity)
- Add comments and documentaion
- Refactor for clarity (consider break it down to smaller pieces - reusable functions)
- Seek for a feedback (share with others - your peers)
